> The Great Belt Bridge (Danish: Storebæltsbroen) or Great Belt fixed link (Danish: Storebæltsforbindelsen) is a multi-element fixed link crossing the Great Belt strait between the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen. It consists of a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprogø in the middle of the Great Belt, and a box-girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprogø and Funen. The total length is 18 kilometres (11 mi).
>
> The term Great Belt Bridge commonly refers to the suspension bridge, although it may also be used to mean the box-girder bridge, especially when discussing the railway, or the link in its entirety. Together with the New Little Belt Bridge, the Great Belt link provides a continuous road and rail connection between Copenhagen and the Danish mainland (the Jutland Peninsula of the European continent). It has the world's seventh-longest main span (1.6 km (1 mi)). Operation and maintenance of the bridge are performed by A/S Storebælt under Sund & Bælt. Maintenance and the original construction are financed by tolls on vehicles and trains making use of the bridge.
>
> Officially named the East Bridge, the suspension bridge was designed by the Danish firms COWI and Ramboll, and the architecture firm Dissing+Weitling. The construction and assembly of the suspended deck were carried out by the company Alsthom Sdem with the consultancy of the Italian Studio de Miranda Associati under the direction of Mario de Miranda. The link replaced the Great Belt ferries service, which had been the primary means of crossing the Great Belt. After more than 50 years of debate, the Danish government decided in 1986 to construct a link; the bridge opened to rail traffic in 1997 and to road traffic in 1998, at the time the world's second longest, beaten by the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge opened a few months previously. At an estimated cost of DKK 21.4 billion (EUR 2.8 billion) (1988 prices), the link is the largest construction project in Danish history. It has reduced travel times significantly; previously taking one hour by ferry, the Great Belt can now be crossed in ten minutes. This link, together with the Øresund Bridge (built 1995–1999) and the Little Belt Bridge, have together enabled driving from mainland Europe to Sweden through Denmark.
